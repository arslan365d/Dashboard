                <h2>History of BlockChain</h2>
                <p>A blockchain is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked
                    together via cryptographic hashes.[1][2][3][4] Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the
                    previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where
                    data nodes are represented by leaves). Since each block contains information about the previous
                    block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional
                    block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that,
                    once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering
                    all subsequent blocks.</p>

                <p>A blockchain is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked

                    its unique features and potential applications beyond cryptocurrency. Its decentralized, distributed
                    ledger technology provides a secure way to store and transfer data, making it resistant to tampering
                    and censorship. Additionally, all transactions on a blockchain are publicly visible, creating a
                    transparent and accountable record. The immutable nature of blockchain ensures that once data is
                    written, it cannot be altered or deleted, further enhancing its reliability.</p>
